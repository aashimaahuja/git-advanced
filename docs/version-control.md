## Version Control

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without conflicts.

### Drawbacks of Traditional Version Control

1. **Maintaining Separate Files**
   - Maintaining separate files for different versions is not scalable. A more efficient system would handle version control within a single file.
     - Example:
       - Git_Course.docx
       - Git_Course_v1.docx
       - Git_Course_v2.docx
       - Git_Course_final.docx

2. **Collaboration**
   - When files exist only on a single computer, collaboration becomes challenging. A distributed system enables easier teamwork.

3. **Reliability**
   - A traditional setup often has a single point of failure. A distributed version control system mitigates this risk by allowing multiple copies of the repository.

### Git Overview

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks the history of changes in files. It allows for collaboration and provides robust features for managing code changes.
